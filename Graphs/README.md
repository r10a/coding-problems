## Graphs

1. Given a string str and array of pairs that indicates which indices in the string can be swapped, return the lexicographically largest string that results from doing the allowed swaps. You can swap indices any number of times. 
```
		Example
		For str = "abdc" and pairs = [[1, 4], [3, 4]], the output should be
		swapLexOrder(str, pairs) = "dbca".
