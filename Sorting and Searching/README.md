## Sorting and Searching

1. sorted_matrix_search.py : Given an M x N matrix in which each row and each column is sorted in ascending order, write a method to find an element.

2. A magic index in an array `A[0...n-1]` is defined to be an index such that `A[i]= i`. Given a sorted array of distinct integers, write a method to find a magic index, if one exists, in array A.
